    <h1>All About Hockey</h1>
    <div>
      <p>
        Hockey is a term used to denote various types of both summer and winter
        team sports which originated on either an outdoor field, sheet of ice,
        or dry floor such as in a gymnasium. There are many types of hockey.
        Some games make the use of skates, either wheeled, or bladed while
        others do not. In order to help make the distinction between these
        various games, the word "hockey" is often preceded by another word i.e.
        "field hockey", "ice hockey", "roller hockey", "rink hockey", or "floor
        hockey". In each of these sports, two teams play against each other by
        trying to manoeuvre the object of play, either a type of ball or a disk
        (such as a puck), into the opponent's goal using a hockey stick. Two
        notable exceptions use a straight stick and an open disk (still referred
        to as a "puck") with a hole in the center instead.
