    <h1>All About Cricket</h1>
    <div>
      <p>
        Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven
        players each on a field at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre)
        pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on
        three stumps. The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team,
        called the bowler, "bowls" (propels) the ball from one end of the pitch
        towards the wicket at the other end, with an "over" being completed once
        they have legally done so six times. The batting side has one player at
        each end of the pitch, with the player at the opposite end of the pitch
        from the bowler aiming to strike the ball with a bat. The batting side
        scores runs either when the ball reaches the boundary of the field, or
        when the two batters swap ends of the pitch, which results in one run.
        The fielding side's aim is to prevent run-scoring and dismiss each
        batter (so they are "out", and are said to have "lost their wicket").
        Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the bowled ball hits the
        stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either catching
        a hit ball before it touches the ground, or hitting a wicket with the
        ball before a batter can cross the crease line in front of the wicket to
        complete a run. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends
        and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided
        by a third umpire and match referee in international matches.

      <h3>Origin of Cricket</h3>
      <p>
        It is generally believed that cricket originated as a children's game in
        the south-eastern counties of England, sometime during the medieval
        period.[4] Although there are claims for prior dates, the earliest
        definite reference to cricket being played comes from evidence given at
        a court case in Guildford in January 1597 (Old Style), equating to
        January 1598 in the modern calendar.
